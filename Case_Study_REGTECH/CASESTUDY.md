## <div align="center"> Business Activities

+ ### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

  + The problem of underbanked cannabis companies is well-established and has created a legitimate issue in how payments are processed, and cash-flows are managed.Second, the cannabis market is highly fragmented. There’s no central aggregator for e-commerce manufacturers and distributors like Amazon in the blossoming industry. Instead, the market is flush with a garden variety of dispensaries, growers, manufacturers, distributors, and highly fragmented technology solutions.Because there is no large corporation operating with economies of scale (e.g., Amazon), cost-efficiencies, like data sharing, marketing, route optimization, marketing analytics, and other marginal business expenses are higher than a more established consumer market.

  Moreover, the lack of such requirements has created a gap in which scalable compliance systems and processes should exist in order to facilitate sustainable regulatory and oversight frameworks, especially those that would allow for the use of electronic payments as opposed to the high-risk nature of a cash-only industry. This last issue is amplified by the fact that marijuana is still classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substance Act. This means that federal and state chartered financial institutions are wary of embracing the cannabis industry, no matter how well regulated it is on an individual state level.Financial Institutions, Regulators, and Business do not have a streamlinend way of communicating and there for subsequently find themselves creating a bottleneck of cash that is tied up.  Built for effieciency and reliability, GCV's purpose is to create a  streamlined and functional channel for MRB (Marijuana Related Business) to grow and thrive without the hastle of slow regulatory roadblocks tieing up their cash.

+ ### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

  + Marijuana Sellers, Consumers and State agencies (both regulators and tax collectors)
  + Market size is growing at a rate as fast as states legalize marijuana
    + The SAFE Banking Act is one of the biggest points of discussion in the cannabis banking space. The consensus seems to be that passage of that legislation is inevitable, but it will not be this year, and Hart agrees. Though it may take time to come to fruition, more banks are interested in entering cannabis banking sooner rather than later. Green Check has carved out a strong niche for those strategic financial institutions that want to begin banking for cannabis, according to Hart.
