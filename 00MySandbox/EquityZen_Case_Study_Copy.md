# EquityZen Case Study

## Overview and Origin

[**EquityZen Securities LLC**](https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/281820) is a registered broker dealer offering investments in privately held technology companies via [*SEC Reg D*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulationd.asp) to accredited investors. Founded May 1, 2013 by Atish Dava, Shriram Bhashyam, and Phil Haslett in New York City as part of the [*500 Startups*](https://500.co/) accelerator program, which provided the intitial funding in 2014. Since its beginning, the company has attracted the attention of notortious angel investors such as [*Timothy Cook Draper*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Draper).  As of April 2020 the company has received approximately $13.5 million in external funding through seed rounds and equity series offers. 

 The sources of funding the company has attracted along with the timing of its incorporation (being  just over one year after the  [*Jump Start Our Busniess Starups Act*
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpstart_Our_Business_Startups_Act) (JOBS Act)
was signed into law in early 2012) gives resonable evidence of how the idea of the business came to fruition.  The JOBS Act loosened SEC regulations allowing small businesses to raise capital through equity offerings without having to go through SEC registration. This posed a new opportunity for early-stage investors, employees, venture capitalist, and institutional investors of maturing start-up ventures to sell their pre-IPO shares to the public via alternative investment methods such as [*crowdfunding*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crowdfunding.asp).  In doing so, it provided the possibility of early access to retail investors wanting exposure to the potential returns these rising stars might offer, but only if they can find a medium to procure the shares.

## Landscape:
EquityZen ,broadly speaking, operates in the [Alternative Investment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternative_investment.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,An%20alternative%20investment%20is%20a%20financial%20asset%20that%20does%20not,all%20examples%20of%20alternative%20investments)
 fintech domain which is characterized by  investments which do not belong any of the three conventional investment catagories e.g. stocks (of publically traded companies), bonds, and cash. Examples of alternative investment are: commodities, privet equity, venture captial, real estate, hedge funds, cyptocurrency, ect.  Crowdfunding is a more recent developement in the domain, which creates a [primary market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primarymarket.asp#:~:text=The%20primary%20market%20is%20where,example%20of%20a%20primary%20market) that offers a large number of investors the opportunity to invest in startups.  EquityZen offers a service akin to crowdfunding, but creates a [secondary market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp#:~:text=The%20secondary%20market%20is%20where,when%20they%20are%20first%20issued.) to offer late-stage pre-IPO investment and trading. 
 
 Within last decade alternative finance has experienced major disruption due to changes in monetary policy of central banks, the evolution of blockchain, deregulation of privet equity offerings, technological innovations, and increased ease of access by consumers to information and technology.  These trends have lowered the barrier of entry, so small fintech startups could compete on the same level as the larger institutions. They have provided more diversified investment options for the average consumer. EquityZen has used these disruptions to its advantage to acheive a level of success that rivals lager players such as [Forge, SharesPost, and CartaX](https://www.harnesswealth.com/articles/selling-your-startup-shares-comparison-secondary-stock-marketplaces/).
